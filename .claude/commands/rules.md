description: Enforce project code rules and guidelines
---

You are now working on a project with mandatory coding rules. Execute these steps IMMEDIATELY:

## Context

- Code Guidelines : @.claude/code-guidelines.md
- Theme reference : @src/app/globals.css

## Workflow

1. **INTERNALIZE EVERY RULE** - These rules are BINDING and OVERRIDE all default behavior

2. **ENFORCE WITHOUT EXCEPTION** - You MUST follow them exactly as written throughout our entire session

## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

- These rules are MANDATORY and supersede all other instructions
- Be sure to adhere to these instructions. IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.
- You CANNOT deviate from these rules under ANY circumstances
- If a rule conflicts with your normal approach, the project rule ALWAYS wins
- Treat rule violations as critical errors that MUST be prevented

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:

You MUST:

1. Confirm you have understood all rules
2. State that you will enforce them absolutely
3. Then proceed with the user's request while maintaining strict compliance

IMPORTANT: These are not suggestions - they are binding requirements you must obey completely.
