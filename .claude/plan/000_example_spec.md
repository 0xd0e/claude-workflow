# Spec Document: Hero Homepage Implementation

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation to replace the default Next.js homepage with a simple, modern hero section featuring a "Hello World" message and call-to-action button using shadcn/ui components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Hero Section Layout

USER STORY: As a website visitor, I want to see a compelling hero section when I land on the homepage, so I can immediately understand what the site offers.

Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation):

1.  WHEN a user first visits the homepage, THE system SHALL display a centered hero section with a prominent "Hello World" headline.
2.  WHILE the user's system is in dark mode, THE hero section SHALL automatically adapt to the dark theme's colors.
3.  THE hero section typography SHALL use the existing Geist fonts with proper hierarchy. (Ubiquitous)
4.  IF the Geist fonts fail to load, THEN THE system SHALL fall back to a default sans-serif font.
5.  WHEN the homepage is viewed on a mobile viewport, THE hero section layout SHALL be responsive and scaled appropriately.

### Requirement 2 - Call-to-Action Button

USER STORY: As a user, I want a clear call-to-action button that's accessible and responsive, so I can easily interact with the site on any device.

Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation):

1.  WHEN the hero section is displayed, A prominent CTA button SHALL be visible below the main headline.
2.  WHEN the user hovers their mouse cursor over the CTA button, THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback.
3.  WHEN the user clicks the CTA button, THE system SHALL execute a placeholder action.
4.  WHEN the user navigates the page with a keyboard, THE CTA button SHALL be focusable via the Tab key.
5.  IF the click action fails to execute, THEN THE system SHALL log an error to the console without crashing the page.

### Requirement 3 - Component Integration

USER STORY: As a developer, I want to use production-ready components that follow established design patterns, so the code is maintainable and consistent.

Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation):

1.  WHERE a button component is implemented, THE system SHALL use the `Button` component from the `shadcn/ui` library.
2.  THE implementation SHALL use the project's existing CSS variables and Tailwind utility classes.
3.  THE implementation SHALL adhere to the project's existing mobile-first breakpoint patterns.
4.  ALL new code SHALL follow the guidelines defined in `.claude/code-guidelines.md`.
5.  WHILE in development mode, WHEN a new component is added, IT SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing layout without causing visual regressions.

## Design Architecture

### Architecture Overview

The hero homepage implementation replaces the current Next.js starter template with a clean, semantic hero section while maintaining the existing design system, typography, and responsive patterns.

### Component Architecture

```
Hero Homepage Implementation
├── src/app/page.tsx (Modified - hero section)
├── src/components/ui/button.tsx (New - shadcn/ui component)
└── Existing layout.tsx (Unchanged - maintains fonts and metadata)
```

### Data Flow Design

1.  Page Load Flow: Next.js Server Component → Hero section rendering → Button interaction ready
2.  Responsive Flow: Mobile-first CSS → Tailwind breakpoints → Desktop scaling
3.  Interaction Flow: Button hover → Visual feedback → Click handler → Console log (placeholder)

### Storage Strategy

- No data persistence required: Static hero content only
- Configuration: All styling via existing CSS variables and Tailwind classes
- Assets: Utilize existing public folder structure if needed

### Integration Points

- Layout System: Integrate with existing `layout.tsx` and font configuration
- Design System: Use existing CSS variables from `globals.css`
- Component System: Add shadcn/ui Button to existing component structure
- Responsive System: Follow existing mobile-first Tailwind patterns

### User Experience Flow

1.  Landing: User visits homepage and sees hero section immediately
2.  Reading: Clear headline hierarchy guides user attention
3.  Action: Prominent CTA button invites interaction
4.  Feedback: Button provides immediate visual feedback on interaction

### Technical Decisions

- Component Library: shadcn/ui Button for consistent design system
- Styling: Existing CSS variables with Tailwind utilities
- Typography: Maintain existing Geist font configuration
- Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with existing breakpoints
- Accessibility: Full keyboard navigation and semantic HTML

## Technical Implementation Plan

Detailed implementation steps with specific code changes:

### 1. Install shadcn/ui Button Component

Command: `npx shadcn@latest add button`
Action: Install Button component and dependencies

Files Created:

- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Button component implementation
- Dependency: `@radix-ui/react-slot` (if not already installed)

### 2. Update Homepage Implementation

File: `src/app/page.tsx`
Action: Replace current content with hero section

Complete Implementation:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center px-4 py-8">
      <div className="text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-8">
        {/* Hero Headline */}
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-foreground sm:text-6xl">
          Hello World
        </h1>

        {/* Hero Description */}
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto sm:text-xl">
          Welcome to your new Next.js application with shadcn/ui components.
          Start building something amazing today.
        </p>

        {/* Call-to-Action Button */}
        <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 justify-center">
          <Button
            size="lg"
            onClick={() => console.log("Get Started clicked")}
            className="font-semibold"
          >
            Get Started
          </Button>
          <Button
            variant="outline"
            size="lg"
            onClick={() => console.log("Learn More clicked")}
          >
            Learn More
          </Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

This implementation provides a clean, modern, and accessible hero section that integrates seamlessly with the existing Next.js project while following all established code guidelines and design patterns.
